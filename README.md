## Vulnerability Scanner

A web-based vulnerability scanner that checks for potential vulnerabilities in web applications. The scanner takes a URL and a list of payloads as input, and checks for vulnerabilities by sending HTTP requests to the URL with the payloads.

### Features
* Scans for vulnerabilities in web applications
* Supports multiple payloads
* Displays results in a user-friendly format

### Usage
1. Enter the URL of the web application to scan
2. Enter the payloads to test (one per line)
3. Click the "SCAN" button to start the scan
4. The scanner will display the results in three categories: Vulnerable, Not Vulnerable, and Redirect

### Categories
#### Vulnerable
* Displays URLs that are vulnerable to the payloads

#### Not Vulnerable
* Displays URLs that are not vulnerable to the payloads

#### Redirect
* Displays URLs that redirect to another location

### Note
This vulnerability scanner is for educational purposes only and should not be used to scan websites without permission.
